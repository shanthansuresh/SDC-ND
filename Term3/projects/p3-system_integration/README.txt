[2] NOTES TO REVIEWERS
(a) We have added a ros parameter value called "simulator"
    in launch/site.launch and launch/site.launch. This value
    is "True" for simulator and "False" for carla. This value 
    is used to load different models for traffic light detection.

(b) We use tensorflow to do the traffic light detection. As it
    takes few seconds to load the model, please wait for 5 seconds
    before unchecking the manual mode in simulator.
