1. tl_detector node is not publishing the correct tl stop line index.
   As a hack, in the waypoint_updater.py, we are trying to stop
   20 waypoints before the tl stop_line index published by traffic_waypoint
   topic. This hack needs to be removed and fix needs to be done in tl_detector
   node.

2. Currently car is not stoping at first red traffic signal.
   This needs to be fixed.
>> Fixed. The publish call() has to be made from traffic_cb and not pose_cb,
   as the variables are shared between these two threads, causing race-around
   condition.


3. Optimization step: Currently inference is happening on all the images.
   This needs to be modified to perform inference only in the vicinity
   of the traffic light.
>> Done. Inference happens only when the car is within 100 waypoints
   before the traffic signal. However, publish to the traffiic_waypoint
   topic happens at the rate at which image_raw publishes images.

4. publish() call in the waypoint_updater.py is being called from traffic_cb.
   Need to check if this call has to be moved to pose_cb.
>> Not required. See point (2).

5. How to upload the huge model file? Need to check with Udacity.
>> Currently plan to send zip files. Will add to github later.
