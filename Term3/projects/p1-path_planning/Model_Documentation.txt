[1] Path Planning Project:
(a) Behavior Planning:
      I use the sensor fusion data to determine if the ego car needs to switch lanes. 
      If the car ahead of ego car is moving slower than the maximum allowed speed of 50mi/hr,
      then I check the s-distance between the ego car and other cars in the other lanes.
      If the distance is greater than heuristically chosen thresholds, and the speeds are 
      suitable, then I switch the ego car to suitable lane.

(b) Prediction:
     There is no implementation of the prediction module, as I assume that the cars
     are moving at constant velocity and seldom change lanes.

(c) Trajectory Generator:
     For smooth trajectory generation, I make use of the splines as exlained in the classroom concept.
     I use waypoints from the previously generated paths that are not consumed by the simulator, along
     with the waypoints generated in the current cycle. This makes the trajectory smooth.


Rubric Criteria:
[a] The code compiles correctly.
>> Yes.

[b] The car is able to drive at least 4.32 miles without incident..
>> Yes, I have tested it for multiple iterations to make sure that velocity, acceleration,
   jerk are not exceeded the specified limits. Also, I have programmed the ego car to
   drive less aggressively, to avoid collision.

[c] The car drives according to the speed limit.
>> Yes, most of the times the car tries to be at 50mi/hr. If not, it considers changing lanes
   to make sure that the velocity is not considerably lesser than the 50mi/hr value.

[d] Max Acceleration and Jerk are not Exceeded.
>> Yes, The car does not exceed a total acceleration of 10 m/s^2 and a jerk of 10 m/s^3.

[e] Car does not have collisions.
>> Yes.

[f] The car stays in its lane, except for the time between changing lanes.
>> Yes.

[g] The car is able to change lanes
>> Yes.

[h] There is a reflection on how to generate paths.
>> You are looking at it currently.
